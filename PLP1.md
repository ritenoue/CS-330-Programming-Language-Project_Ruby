History

1. Ruby
2. Ruby was created in the mid-1990s (released in 1995) by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. The language was created as a general purpose language, but Matsumoto created the language as a mashup of his favorite languages. These languages are Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
3. Ruby is a general purpose language. However, a framework built on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, is used to build web pages and applications. Projects built with Ruby include GitHub and Airbnb.
4. To learn Ruby I will be using a combination of online articles and textbooks offered through the ACM. Like Tutorialspoint's overview of ruby  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/index.htm and Beginning Ruby 3: From Beginner to Pro by Carleton DiLeo and Peter Cooper on the O'riley website (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beginning-ruby-3/9781484263242/).

Getting Started

1. To install ruby first, go to https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and select the latest version of Ruby with the Dev kit. Then install VSCode as the IDE. From here, in VSCode install the ruby extention and the code runner extension.
2. This language does not have a recommended programming environment. Since it does not have a recommended environment, I chose VSCode because I already have it installed and use it frequently.
3. With the code runner extension, all you have to do to run the program is press the run arrow button in VSCode. However, Ruby files can be also run via the terminal.
4. Comments are made using the hash/pound symbol (#), similar to how comments are made in Python.
