History

1. Ruby
2. Ruby was created in the mid-1990s (released in 1995) by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. The language was created as a general purpose language, but Matsumoto created the language as a mashup of his favorite languages. These languages are Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
3. Ruby is a general purpose language. However, a framework built on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, is used to build web pages and applications. Projects built with Ruby include GitHub and Airbnb.
4. To learn Ruby I will be using a combination of online articles and textbooks offered through the ACM. Like Tutorialspoint's overview of ruby  (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/index.htm) and Beginning Ruby 3: From Beginner to Pro by Carleton DiLeo and Peter Cooper on the O'riley website (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beginning-ruby-3/9781484263242/) and the official Ruby documentation (http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/).

Getting Started

1. To install ruby first, go to https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and select the latest version of Ruby with the Dev kit. Then install VSCode as the IDE. From here, in VSCode install the ruby extention and the code runner extension.
2. This language does not have a recommended programming environment. Since it does not have a recommended environment, I chose VSCode because I already have it installed and use it frequently.
3. With the code runner extension, all you have to do to run the program is press the run arrow button in VSCode. However, Ruby files can be also run via the terminal.
4. Comments are made using the hash/pound symbol (#), similar to how comments are made in Python.

Data Types and Naming Conventions

1. Ruby variables can be named using alfanumeric characters and underscores. They cannot start with numbers or capital letters. Identifiers that start with capitals will be considered constants by the Ruby compiler.
2. The Ruby language is dynamically typed.
3. Ruby is strongly typed.
4. Since Ruby is strongly typed you cannot perform opperations that are not within the logic of Ruby. So the statement x = "5" + 6 will not run. This does not run because in Ruby you cannot add a string to an integer.
5. Refering to the file dataTypes.arb you can see how variables are declared and some examples of how the can be used. It also shows the data types available for use. Variables in Ruby have few limitations. The biggest one is that you cannot add/concatanate unlike variables with each other. The documentation on Ruby does not mention the limitations in great detail.
6. Ruby has both primitive and complex data types. The primitive data types it has are integer, string, and floating point numbers. The complex data types are arrays, hashs, ranges, regex expressions, and symbols.
